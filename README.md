# Projects
This repository contains all the projects I did during my undergraduate degree at Shiv Nadar University, the PG Diploma in ML &amp; AI, at International Institute of Information Technology, Banglore and during the first semester of my Masters degree at the University of Rochester.
The projects were done using data from UCI Machine Learning repository, real industry data provided by IIIT-B, United States Department of Housing and Urban Development website, and have numerous applications across fields.
